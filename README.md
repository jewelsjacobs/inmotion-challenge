# What this app has
## Angular with Webpack
I really like Webpack but it can be a pain to set up so I used a Yeoman generator:
[generator-angular-webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-angular-webpack)
Information on the scaffolding structure, libraries and features can be found [here](https://github.com/KarolAltamirano/generator-angular-webpack/blob/master/app/templates/common/README.md)
including gulp commands, etc.
If you are interested in editing, using the development features or building this project, please take a look.
