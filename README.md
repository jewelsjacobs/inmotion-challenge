# [InMotion Movie App Coding Challenge](./CHALLANGE.md)

# Demo
Hosted on modulus: http://movieapp-59944.onmodulus.net/

# Requirements to run app locally
- NodeJS v4.0 or newer
- npm v3.3 or newer

# Install
1. Clone project
1. Run `npm run build` inside the root directory of the project to build for production.
1. Run `npm run build-dev` inside the root directory of the project to build for development.

# Run for production
1. Run `npm run app` inside the root directory of the project.

# Run for development with browserSync and watch
1. Run `gulp` inside the root directory of the project.

# What this app has
## Angular with Webpack / ES6
I really like Webpack but it can be a pain to set up so I used a Yeoman generator:
[generator-angular-webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-angular-webpack)
Information on the scaffolding structure, libraries and features can be found [here](https://github.com/KarolAltamirano/generator-angular-webpack/blob/master/app/templates/common/README.md)
including gulp commands, etc.
If you are interested in editing, using the development features or building this project, please take a look.

## Extra Libraries / Modules
- [angular-ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)
- [angular-toarrayfilter](https://github.com/petebacondarwin/angular-toArrayFilter) to use an object in an angular filter
which by default can only accept an array
- [expressjs](http://expressjs.com/) to run the app using html push state

## Challenge requirements satisfied
- Movie CRUD operations with requested fields
- Abstracted functionality for both localStorage and $http REST service. Example shows working integration with firebase - to view
    make following modification in _line 47_ `src/scripts/app/movieApp.js` _line 47_:

    ```
     .constant('API', 'firebase');
    ```
    and then run locally:

    ```
    $ npm run build-dev
    $ gulp
    ```
- Used AngularJS with MVC architecture
- Has Movie search
- Has at least one Service, Controller, Directive and Filter (filter is inline for search)
- **bonus** Used lodash
- **bonus** Used bootstrap

## If I had more time . .
I would have:

- added unit / e2e tests
- added api documentation
- stuck to git flow convention with cleaner squashed commits
- cleaned up some of the boilerplate cruft

## AngularJS Source Files
The rest are utility, build, boilerplate and loader files
